    "The New York Knicks have been struggling for years to perform competitvely in the league for a long time. There are several ways to build a team through the draft, free agency, and trades. Ideally, there would be a balance between the methods. Unfortunately, the Knicks haven't been successful with their young players to build through the draft. The last player drafted by the Knicks to sign a multi-year deal after rookie deal was Charlie Ward, who was drafted in 1994.\n",

    "This project tests various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Extra Trees, and various other ensemble methods. We first created the baseline models with basic parameters to analyze how the predictors performed. Then we applied hyperparameter tuning on different models using the Pipeline, GridSearchCV, and RandomizedSearchCV to find the best working model. We further optimize by combining the tuned models into various ensemble models such as Stacker Classifier and AdaBoosting."
